## Development

This project was developed in Qt5 using [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer?hsCtaTracking=9f6a2170-a938-42df-a8e2-a9f0b1d6cdce%7C6cb0de4f-9bb5-4778-ab02-bfb62735f3e5).

All code is written in C++ using the [Qt framework and its libraries](http://doc.qt.io/).

## Credits

All application icons are open source. Credit goes to [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/), created by Cole Bemis. (I colored them in for this app, though.)

The code for highlighting the current line and numbering the margins on the left was borrowed from the official [Qt Code Editor Example](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-widgets-codeeditor-example.html) tutorial. All other code is original.
