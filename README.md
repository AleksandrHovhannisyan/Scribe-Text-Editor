All code is written in C++ using the [Qt framework and its libraries](http://doc.qt.io/).

The code for highlighting the current line and numbering the margins on the left was borrowed from the official [Qt Code Editor Example](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-widgets-codeeditor-example.html) tutorial. All other code is original.
